## Problems I Ran Into & How I Solved Them

### 1. Hydration Mismatch Error on `<body>` Tag

**Problem:** React threw a hydration mismatch warning because browser extensions (like Grammarly) inject custom attributes into the `<body>` element during client-side rendering, causing a mismatch with the server-rendered HTML.

**Solution:** Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<body>` tag in `app/layout.tsx`. This tells React to ignore attribute differences on that element — a standard pattern when using `next-themes` or when browser extensions modify the DOM.

### 2. Double Folder Creation (Real-Time + Optimistic UI Conflict)

**Problem:** When creating a folder, it appeared twice in the sidebar. This happened because:
1. The optimistic update immediately added a temp folder to the list.
2. Supabase's real-time subscription then fired an `INSERT` event and added the same folder again (with its real database ID).

**Solution:** Added deduplication logic to the real-time folder subscription handler. When the real-time event arrives, it checks if a folder with the same `name` + `color` already exists (the temp one) and replaces it with the real database version. If the exact `id` already exists, it skips entirely.

### 3. Missing Database Columns (`folder_id`, `is_favorite`)

**Problem:** After adding folder and favorites features in the code, the Supabase `bookmarks` table didn't have the corresponding `folder_id` and `is_favorite` columns, causing errors like:
> "Could not find the 'folder_id' column of 'bookmarks' in the schema cache"

**Solution:** Ran an `ALTER TABLE` migration to add both columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE bookmarks
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS folder_id UUID REFERENCES folders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### 4. Nested `<button>` Inside `<button>` Hydration Error

**Problem:** The folder items in the sidebar had edit/delete buttons nested inside a clickable `<button>` parent, which is invalid HTML and triggers React hydration errors.

**Solution:** Changed the parent wrapper from `<button>` to a `<div>` with `role="button"` and `onClick`, while keeping the child action buttons as actual `<button>` elements. Added `e.stopPropagation()` on child buttons to prevent event bubbling.

### 5. Inconsistent Cursor Styles Across Interactive Elements

**Problem:** Some buttons and clickable elements showed the default cursor instead of the pointer cursor, making the UI feel inconsistent.

**Solution:** Added global CSS rules in `globals.css` to automatically set `cursor: pointer` on all `button`, `a`, and `[role="button"]` elements, and `cursor: not-allowed` on disabled buttons. This eliminated the need to add `cursor-pointer` to every individual element.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

### 3. Database Setup
Run the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create folders table (must be created first for foreign key)
CREATE TABLE folders (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '#FF1B6D',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create bookmarks table
CREATE TABLE bookmarks (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_favorite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  folder_id UUID REFERENCES folders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE bookmarks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE folders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Bookmarks policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own bookmarks" ON bookmarks FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own bookmarks" ON bookmarks FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own bookmarks" ON bookmarks FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own bookmarks" ON bookmarks FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Folders policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own folders" ON folders FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own folders" ON folders FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own folders" ON folders FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own folders" ON folders FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Enable Realtime
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE bookmarks;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE folders;
```

### 4. Configure Google OAuth
1. Go to Supabase → **Authentication** → **Providers** → Enable **Google**
2. Add Google OAuth credentials (Client ID + Secret)
3. Set redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

### 5. Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project into Vercel
3. Add environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
4. Update Google OAuth redirect URL in Supabase to: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback`
5. Deploy!
